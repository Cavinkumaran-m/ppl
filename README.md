PPL's App:

    Itâ€™s an app that is used to file, manage complaints about problems that the society faces everyday but in a more technological way. Instead of years old petitioning system and recent online forms, our app can pave way for errorless, faster and automated solutions.


Description:  

    Typically petitions are signed by some people in their locality to seek solution for problems in their society. It may be a street lamp problem, drainage maintenance or even road bumps that has to be reported to a particular authority in charge of the situation, our app can connect people for this common cause using Global Positioning System to inform the nearby people who are in a certain radius range of the complaint's co-ordinates and creates a polling for getting support/e-signatures from people who were affected by the same problem. If someone tries to file a fake complaint, it can be marked as spam by the people around. This helps to build a fool proof complain management system. So that only legitimate problems are brought forth to the authorities using our app.
