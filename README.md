Itâ€™s an app that is used to file complaints, typically one signed by many people in their locality for a particular cause, it may be a street lamp, drainage or even a road appealing to particular authority in charge of the situation. Our app is used to connect people for a particular problem using GPS and tracking the near by people who are affected by the same problem  And creates a polling, for getting e signatures from people who are affected by the problem in that locality to verify the users and create a fool proof polling. So that only legitimate problems are brought forth to the authority using GPS location of the complaint where the problem has occurred.
